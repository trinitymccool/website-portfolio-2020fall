    <h3>About Me<h3>
      <p>I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh who is majoring in Film and Media Studies. I plan to graduate in the spring of 2021, and plan to pursue a career in filmmaking, videography/photography, screenwriting, or cinematography. Art has been one of the most important things in my life ever since I was young, these are just a handful of the things I have created, I hope you enjoy them! I'm currently co-directing a short film, and working on the biggest commissioned painting I've had yet.
