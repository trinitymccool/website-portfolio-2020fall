    <h1>Paintings and Sketches</h1>

    <h2>The Legendary Bird Trio</h2>
      <p>Pok√©mon is one of my favorite video game franchises, so I dedicated this painting to the legendary birds of the Kanto region-- Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.</p>

    <h2>Link and Zelda</h2>
      <p>Another one of my favorite video game franchises is The Legend of Zelda! This is a super quick and rough sketch of Link and Zelda from the game Breath of the Wild.</p>

    <h2>My First Commission</h2>
     <p>This was my very first commissioned painting. It was for my friend who is a very good Super Smash Bros. player! (photo to come later)</p>

    <h2>Untitled Goose Game</h2>
      <p>One of the most fun indie games is Untitled Goose Game, so I dedicated a whole painting to it!</p>

    <h2>Persona 5</h2>
      <p>One of my favorite video games of all time is Persona 5, so I painted the protagonist, Joker.</p>

    <h2>Harry Styles</h2>
      <p>This is by far the worst painting I have ever done, but I decided to include it anyway because I tried a new art style than what I am used to. It is safe to say this art style isn't my thing, but I still like the colors! This was inspired by one of my favorite Harry Styles song, Sunflower, vol. 6.</p>
