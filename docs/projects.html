    <h2>Visual Argument</h2>
      <p>In this project, the goal was to make an argument or statement using only visuals. I chose the concept of Memento Mori. We only have one life, we need to make the best of it!</p>

    <h2>Soundscape</h2>
      <p>Contrary to the previous project, here, we have to create a story using only sound (not sure how to add an mp3 yet, will be added in final).</p>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="docs/The Final Delivery.mp3"
      type="audio/mp3">
      <source src='docs/The Final Delivery.mp3'/>
      type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>

    <h2>Year of Creativity</h2>
      <p>During the 2019-2020 school year, I was a videographer for the University of Pittsburgh's Year of Creativity. These are some of my favorite videos!(still learning to embed videos, will be here for final)</p>

    <h2>Short Films</h2>
    <p>Will be here in the final draft.</p>
